                            At the age of five, in pink tulle and satin ballet point shoes, I dreamt of the stage. My mother had taken me to pro dance classes since I was a child, and so I thought that was where I belonged. However, at age 12, before I could make a career of the graceful and whirling fuetes, I had a knee injury before the required physical exams that left me permanently in the wings. As devastating as it was back then, I see it now as something that had to happen. Moving away from my mother’s dream made me realice that I had to find something of my own. That incident pushed me to find new challenges, and life rewarded me with a new stage to make my great passion come true.
                            My journey to discover the profession I truly love now, dentistry, started in a rather peculiar way. As a child I had posterior cross-bite, which was a long process to fix. In Cuba we did not have the possibility to wear actual braces so I had to use a “Hawley apparatus” which was modified multiple times. During this process I went so much to the dentist and constantly talked about it with my cousin. I was so intrigued by what my doctors were doing that I tried my best to describe and explain it to him. I asked a lot of questions to better understand everything that was going on, which made me even more facinated by how interesting dentistry is.
                            My newfound interest in the dental career got me involved in many activities related to the profession: coordinating and assisting workshops on dental hygiene, helping dental preventive programs, and volunteering with my own dentist with children who were afraid of dental treatments. I not only shared my own experiences, but also went around visiting underprivileged schools in Cuba and taught children how to brush their teeth. Each time I got more involved in the dental career; I was more fascinated by its artistry combined with community.
                            <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">And so I applied to school that would help me fulfill my dream. A few years ago, in my native Cuba, I was among twenty students who were selected from a group of hundreds to attend a prestigious dental college. In this college I had many experiences that fortified my want to become a dentist. I remember this as my proudest moment in college. While I'm working on a patient that was provided by the school, the doctor who was teaching us saw me work and asked me to be a student helper. This was a very big deal to me because there were only five student helpers in the entire school. Thanks to my tenacity and hard work, my dream was coming true. All of a sudden, however, my family and I had the opportunity to immigrate to this country. My family chose to immigrate because of the terrible things happening in Cuba, in my youth I lived in a “solar” which was a hallway with dozens of minuscule apartments, and we all shared a singular bathroom. The water had to be carried with a bucket because the showers were broken and water could not reach the apartment. I lived there with my parents and my three siblings in one very small room. Living in Cuba was not an option anymore, there was no future or safety anymore. With immigration came sacrifice and for some time. However, I never stopped studying, so I financially assisted my family and at the same time went to school and learned English. The change from my country to America, though it hit me hard, was not going to keep me from my dream.  For years, I worked hard, it was a big challenge, but I was determined to succeed.
                            Soon, I took center stage once more as I enrolled in Florida International University (FIU), and almost immediately, joined the pre-dental society to attend meetings and manual dexterity workshops. While attending FIU, I was able to get a Dental Assistant License, to start gaining real world experience in the dental profession. I remember a little girl who was afraid of starting with braces. Before I even sat her in the exam chair, I showed her some of my old pictures of when I was using braces and how the sacrifice of using braces for two years aligned my teeth. We smiled at the same time, and she got excited just thinking of how straight her teeth would be. We chatted about the harmless process and how using cool braces could be the envy of other girls and boys. When she bravely sat down to begin, I knew my work that day changed her relationship with oral healthcare, and most important, I learned that becoming a dentist is just as much about caring for the individual as it is for their teeth.
                            When I began working for Leon Medical Center, I deepened my knowledge on how culture and language barriers can hurt our patients. Because I live in South Florida, I usually encounter patients from Latin America who don’t speak enough English to understand different procedures. I remember when Eduardo needed a Root-Canal, he could not be convinced until he understood what was happening. The dentist I was working with was from Michigan, and he didn’t speak Spanish fluently but thanks to my bilingual skills, I was able to explain everything to the patient including the cameral access that his molar would have.
                            Unexpectedly after the arrival of COVID in 2020 I finished my Bachelor in Biology and had the opportunity to work at DENTALVANA: inspired by Nirvana to experience Dentistry in a state of Bliss, Serenity and Perfection! Where I have grown professionally, designing Emax and Zirconia crowns, Felix's smile on his face when my Dr Julia and I delivered his posterior molar crowns on the same day, he was only at the clinic for 4 hours and left completely satisfied. I still remembered Katie one of our sweeties patients saying: I went here because having wisdom tooth pain and one of them was just making my life absolute terror at night  and her fear appears in her face until we offered laughing gas for the wisdom tooth extraction in a calm environment , she was very pleased.
                            Ultimately, I have been able to get to this point in my life, thanks to my effort, perseverance, and the help of my family throughout these years. In the future, I see myself becoming a dentist and pursuing my career in dentistry and hopefully being able to help not only adults but also kids. I plan on helping those who also can’t afford insurance or even a visit to the dentist. I see dentistry as a space to serve my community and aid in making a difference little by little. It is in the small changes and in the small differences that I will be able to help my community nurture their relationship to this noble profession.
